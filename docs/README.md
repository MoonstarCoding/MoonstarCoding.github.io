# Mark Hutchison's GitHub Pages

Now don't be alarmed, what you're seeing here is not a mistake. GitHub pages by default requires a directory to use as the homepage. I haven't had a lot of spare time, so I never got around to making one.

I highly recomending going to my GitHub for a more professional looking "About Me" page until I implement one here.

Or, you can go to an exiting page I have set up showing off my many projects:

## My Projects:

### BTD6 Autoplay

A fun Python bot that will load JSON configuration files and play the game according to the instructions present in the JSON files. With the latest updates, it is far easier to make new maps now and design a script for every map.

### mark-hutchison.codes

This is a little sample resume I have been working on. It is nothing special, but it does have a couple websites that I developed freelance, and some general information about myself.

### Andrew's CSS Template

My friend Andrew has never been good at finding where to start when designing a webpage. He loves minimalistic desigs, and he also knows he needs to be mobile friendly, but he isn't very good at CSS.
So, being a cool guy, I made him a CSS template to use, and put it on GitHub pages so he could see how it felt on multiple devices.

### Pixel Painter

Ever just want to doodle some pixel art, but don't want to download any painting softwares? Well, I did... So I made a website using P5.js that allows you to make Pixel art. It has your basic colours, plus a "Pick a Colour" option and fill bucket.

### hashi-js

I am addicted to the game Hashi. I absolutely love the varients I have played and just knew I had to code it. So I grabbed P5.js and made my own version. Sadly, due to time constraints, I couldn't add the prevention of bridge overlap like is in actaul Hashi, but it does have randomly generated boards (all of which are 100% possible).

### 1 hour challenge (Trivia)

Alright, this was the sadest defeat of my life. I had gotten something that I thought was working and did it in the time frame. I was so pleased, andd even continued adding questions for it after I was done to make it playable... And then I actually QA tested it... Yeah, it is completely busted, but it was still a lot of fun and I will continue to show it off as a testiment to my skill and an example that nothing is truely perfect.

### The Dorm Entertainment System Blog

A first year Multi-Media project that became this. Man, it waas fun making the website for this, although it was nothing special. I really enjoyed the project as a whole... even if I did quite a bit of it solo.
